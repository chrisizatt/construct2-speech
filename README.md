# construct2-speech
This is a speech recognition plugin for construct2, the game engine.
I made this plugin for a Science project and a project to help Game devlopers easily add acessibility to their games. I haven't fully 
solved the problem, But I have for all construct2 game developers. If you use Construct2, All you have to do is use the tutorial video
below to load my plugin (Download found in branch) into your Construct 2 copy:

I also made an example game with the plugin inside. you can try it out by clicking the image below:

I am still working out a Few Problem though. One problem is that the recognizer is slow. How do I fix this? I do not know yet, But I will keep trying to figure it out and update it when I do. I hope this helps game developers. And I hope The Veterains and others who have arm, hand, and eye disibility that that they will be able to see this as well. So far, The ShockingMind.weebly.com has used my code to help kids read. To use the code, You can find it by clicking the Icon:
