# construct2-speech
This is a speech recognition plugin for construct2, the game engine.
I made this plugin for a Science project and a project to help Game devlopers easily add acessibility to their games. I haven't fully solved the problem, But I have for all construct2 game developers. If you use Construct2, All you have to do is use the tutorial video below to load my plugin (Download found in branch) into your Construct 2 copy.
